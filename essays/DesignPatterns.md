## Everyone has a pattern
Before I ever thought that I could get into something like programming, I spent my time sewing, designing, and sharing patterns for tons of clothing ideas. A design pattern in sewing allows someone to create and alter a garment of clothing without having to spend hours of time measuring and adjusting fabric to make a shape. It allows people fast problem solving with an ability to transform it into what they want. When learning about design patterns in coding I was surprised to find how similar this is to sewing! In software engineering, a design pattern is a general and repeatable solution to common problems that pop up in software design. While it isn’t a finished solution and code, it can be easily turned into one. It is a description that has been tested and proven to help solve problems and can be used in a lot of different ways. They help to speed up development. They can be helpful because they can solve small issues that can become a much bigger problem once a program is implemented. It also has the ability to make code more readable when working in larger groups, as design patterns are widely used and recognizable.

## The Gang of Four

In 1994, four well-known computer scientists known as the Gang of Four wrote about the advantages of using design patterns in a book called “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”. In this book they talk about and describe three categories of design patterns. These categories are;

## Creational Pattern: 
These design patterns are used to solve problems with class instantiation or objects. This category includes class-creation patterns with inheritance and object-creational patterns with delegation.

## Behavioral Pattern: 
A pattern that is used to solve problems that are focused around class object communication would fall into this category. These patterns are mostly used for communication between objects. 

## Structural Pattern: 
This category focuses on structures or relations between classes and objects and their composition and interactions.

## Using design patterns in my code, instead of my sewing

Now that I have started to learn about software development, I am using design patterns in a new way. In one of my early computer sciences I was assigned a project that used class and object composition, class instantiation, and class object communication with the help of design patterns. For this project I had to create an object-oriented pokemon hierarchy for the different Pokemon species. I was given an idea of how it needed to be implemented and the class extensions through a blueprint. I had no idea at this point that I was using a design pattern, but learning about them now I can see how helpful they can be.
