## Initial thoughts:

As a newcomer to Javascript, I am very excited to learn as much as I can of it. So far I have been very pleased with my small projects using the language. After using I have only ever using Java and C for the year and a half I used it in my classes at school, I find that there are things I’m forgetting to do. This is only because JavaScript doesn’t require as many steps as these other languages make you take. I have found that writing in JavaScript to be simpler and allows more versatility. So far I have found the language to be very interesting, and I’m already enjoying learning ways to simplify my code. I am nervous about getting too used to it’s formatting, and making obvious mistakes when I try to switch between the different languages. Once of the things that I’m excited to see about JavaScript is its interoperability. It is able to be used effortlessly with other programming languages, which makes it favourable when developing applications. This makes it very popular for a lot of well-known companies, which makes it an important skill to learn.  

## What I've already learned:

One of the things that I am starting to notice is that all languages are similar in many ways, and JavaScript is not excluded from this. Learning Java and C before JavaScript helped me learn that the logic of code is always the same, but how you implement it is different. This language seems to have small differences in its implication, as it’s faster and allows more creativity. When it comes to software engineering, I believe that it will be good for smaller projects. However, I think that once you get into serious software it can become problematic. When a program turns into thousands of lines of code it can become very difficult to expect a higher level of quality and hard to maintain. 

## Conclusion:

There seems to be many advantages and disadvantages to working in JavaScript. I am enthusiastic about learning it, as I think it will be helpful once I get out into the field. I also think that it will be very enjoyable to learn as it makes me think of new ways to solve the same problems I’ve been learning about since I started coding.
